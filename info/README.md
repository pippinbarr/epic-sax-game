*Epic Sax Game* was written in ActionScript 3 using Adobe's FlashBuilder 4.5 and the excellent [Flixel](http://www.flixel.org/) library. It is based on the Eurovision song ["Run Away" by SunStroke Project and Olia Tira](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C-VMHOlCyW8) and the immortal ["Epic Sax Guy 10 Hours"](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KHy7DGLTt8g). The music comes from the MIDI version of the song made by [David Sexton](http://www.midi.ru/home/138892/). The font in *Epic Sax Game* is [Commodore 64 Pixelized](http://www.dafont.com/commodore-64-pixelized.font) by [Devin Cook](http://www.devincook.com/). The game is now being presented in emulation thanks to [ruffle](https://ruffle.rs).
