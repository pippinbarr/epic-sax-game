# Epic Sax Game

## Warning: Flash

This game was exported in Flash and, as you probably know, Flash has been discontinued. As such, I can only provide access to the source code and the `.swf` file at the moment.

If you happen to have an ancient computer that still runs Flash in the browser, or a copy of the Adobe Flash Standalone Player, you should be able to run the game.

At some point I may port the game to JavaScript or similar, and it's possible that the [ruffle](https://ruffle.rs/) Flash emulator will get to a point where this game will run again. Let's see.

## Description
Epic Sax Game was written in ActionScript 3 using Adobe's FlashBuilder 4.5 and the excellent [Flixel](http://www.flixel.org/) library. It is based on the Eurovision song ["Run Away" by SunStroke Project and Olia Tira](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C-VMHOlCyW8) and the immortal ["Epic Sax Guy 10 Hours"](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KHy7DGLTt8g). The music comes from the MIDI version of the song made by [David Sexton](http://www.midi.ru/home/138892/). The font in Epic Sax Game is [Commodore 64 Pixelized](http://www.dafont.com/commodore-64-pixelized.font) by [Devin Cook](http://www.devincook.com/).
